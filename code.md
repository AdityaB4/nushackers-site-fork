  <h3>In Support of Git</h3>

  <p>We use Github to store and share our code. Github, in turn, is powered by Linus Torvald's Git - a <em>distributed</em> version control system. If you don't know how to use Git, and you're interested in learning it, we recommend that you read <a href="http://progit.org/book/">Pro Git</a> chapters 1-5, or <a href="/contact">request a workshop</a>.</p>
---
We manage an <a href="https://github.com/nushackers/">nushackers git repository on github.com</a>. It contains things like <a href="https://github.com/nushackers/nushackers-site">source code of this web site</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nushackers/hackerschool">source code of our hackerschool website</a>. Free feel to clone/fork any of those or, even better, send us pull requests!

Also, NUS students and faculty members are welcome to <a href="/contact/">contact us</a> if you want us to maintain and publicize your code!

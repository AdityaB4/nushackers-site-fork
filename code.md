  <h3>In Support of Git</h3>

  <p>We use Github to store and share our code. Github, in turn, is powered by Linus Torvald's Git - a <em>distributed</em> version control system. If you don't know how to use Git, and you're interested in learning it, we recommend that you read <a href="http://progit.org/book/">Pro Git</a> chapters 1-5, or <a href="/contact">request a workshop</a>.</p>

We manage an <a href="https://github.com/nushackers/">nushackers git repository on github.com</a>. Some projects that we currently host:
<blockquote><strong><a href="https://github.com/nushackers/IVLE-Forum-Leecher">IVLE Forum Leecher</a></strong> by Hong Dai Thanh- a Java program that scrapes the NUS IVLE forums and archives it on a user's computer.

<a href="https://github.com/nushackers/NUS-Hackers-Theme"><strong>NUS Hackers.org Wordpress Theme</strong></a> - a semantic, HTML5 theme currently in use on this very website. GPL-licensed, free to use. Built on top of Automattic's Toolbox skeleton theme.</blockquote>
NUS students and faculty members are welcome to <a href="/contact/">contact us</a> if they want us to maintain and publicize their code for them.

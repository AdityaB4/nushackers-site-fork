NUS Hackers is run group of student-volunteers, the coreteam. Our long term goal is to build a healthy community of passionate hackers in NUS. We think that this benefits everyone: professors can source for good programmers; startups and tech companies are able to recruit from a central pool; students get to meet and learn from like-minded peers (and get opportunities, i.e. from professors and tech companies). 

## What we do

We run several events regularly:

- Friday Hacks
- Hacker School
- Hack&Roll
- look after/maintain Download@NUS (an upcoming webapp and mirror for various open source projects)
- NUS Hackerspace

## How we are structured
We call ourselves “coreteam” instead of “committee” because we have a flat structure. We have one extremely charismatic president, that’s all. The rest of us are team members, whose roles and responsibilities are assigned flexibly and on-demand.

## What we’re looking for
* Understanding of our vision: our work, however significant we think, is mostly thankless - it will be difficult for you to carry on if you don’t believe in what we do
* Reasonable level of commitment

## Want to join us?
You can <a href="/contact/">email us</a>, or approach any one of us any time. We will then set up an informal interview with you - usually a chat with two members of coreteam over lunch to allow us to find out more about you. Things like why you want to join, what you have in mind and so on. So we recommend you take part in some of our events and check out our website before approaching us. It is of course also a chance for you to find out more about us, so feel free to ask any questions as well!

And no, we don’t hold elections (except at the very rare incident when we can’t pick a president ;P).

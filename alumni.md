Here is a list of former coreteam members. We are thankful to them for their service.

<strong>Divyanshu Arora</strong> was a Computer Science undergraduate at NUS. His time is mostly split among web development, linux sys administration, and random hacks. Oh, and reading <em>interesting</em> books. <em>More about him at</em> <a title="Or, a-really-long-domain-name.com" href="http://www.darora.com">darora.com</a>.

<strong>Angad Singh</strong> was a Computer Engineering undergraduate. He joined linuxNUS in his first month in NUS and has been with it ever since. He codes to scratch itches, here and there. He also specializes in Embedded Systems with a varied interest in micro-controllers. He started the HackDay Series with the help of his team in NUS. <em>More about him at</em> <a href="http://angad.sg">angad.sg</a>.

<strong>Shan</strong> can almost always be spotted engulfed in either his Android or his laptop. He is an advocate of open source software, and swears by Linux. If not currently engaged by a gadget that is powered up, he would either be tearing it apart to figure out how it works, or to hack it to make it faster, better and more useful! Zealous about stargazing and classical music. Just to name a couple of facets that make up Shan!

<strong>Rahul Gokul</strong> is a hardware hacker.

<strong>Heng Low Wee</strong> was a Computer Science undergraduate. He supports the idea of open source software, and is interested in learning more about anything <em>cool</em>. He is now into developing his first Android app. <em>More about him at</em> <a href="http://about.me/lwheng">about.me/lwheng</a>

<strong>Shawn Tan</strong> was a Computer Science undergraduate and plans to pursue a career in research. He interests lie in machine learning and AI in general.

<strong>Laurence Putra Franslay</strong> was a Computer Science undergraduate, and focuses mainly in the area of distributed systems and computer security. He is quite active in the Singaporean geek scene, and is one of the organisers of <a href="http://geekcamp.sg">Geekcamp</a>. <em>More about him at</em> <a href="http://www.geeksphere.net">geeksphere.net</a>.

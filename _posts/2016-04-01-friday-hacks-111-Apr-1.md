### Talk 1: The ABCs of XSS.

#### Talk Description:
Cross-site scripting is a very common computer security vulnerability usually found in web applications. XSS is a form of injection attack where it allows attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by victims.

There are many different types of XSS, and although the common ones are known to many, there are variants which are less known. Quan Yang will be sharing about the different types of XSS, the common ones and the lesser known ones, along with many real-life examples of them.

#### Speaker Profile

Quan Yang is a year 3 Computer Science undergraduate at NUS, and is a co-founder of NUS Greyhats, the special interest group for Information Security in NUS.

### Talk 2: TBC :)

### Talk 3: Q&A with Jeff Moss

[Jeff Moss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Moss_(hacker)) has spent the last 17 years as founder and director of [Black Hat](https://www.blackhat.com/) and [DefCon](https://www.defcon.org/), two of the most important security conferences in the world. Moss speaks frequently before a wide range of audiences on the topic of computer and information security. In 2009 Moss was appointed to the Homeland Security Advisory Council to provide advice and recommendations to the Secretary on matters related to homeland security. Moss is uniquely qualified with his ability to bridge the gap between the underground researcher community and law enforcement, between the worlds of pure research and responsible application.

<div>

At Viki we collect and analyze over 60M user-generated data points everyday. This talk goes into deep technical and architecture design to share about the infrastructure, the different tools and process we’ve built with our analytics system. Specifically we’ll talk about how we collect data, how we process data and how we present data.

The current system is capable of supporting a variety of business and product needs: automated business reporting, a/b testing, cohort analysis, funnel analysis, recommendation engine, etc.

Technology stack: Ruby, Python, R, NodeJS, Golang, PostgreSQL, Java, Storm, Hadoop with Apache Hive.

We are also looking for summer interns - http://bit.ly/viki-summer-internship .

We will talk more about our summer internship offers for students, what a typical intern’s life looks like and what works our past interns have done at the end of the talk.

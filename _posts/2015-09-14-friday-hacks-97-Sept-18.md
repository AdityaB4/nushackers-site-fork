## Scalability principles to bring your web application to the next level

Creating web applications have become the norm nowadays with the abundance of frameworks and libraries you can use. However, most web developers are still not aware of what to do when their applications reach a certain scale and start to perform poorly. This talk will introduce some bread-and-butter techniques that PayPal and other companies employ to successfully serve a global customer base. The techniques range from small changes that you can start doing immediately to re-designing everything from scratch. 

Speaker profile:

Ryan is a software engineer at PayPal. He graduated from NUS Computer Science in 2014 and has been working on consumer-facing web applications at PayPal ever since. He loves optimizing applications and complaining about how slow everything is.

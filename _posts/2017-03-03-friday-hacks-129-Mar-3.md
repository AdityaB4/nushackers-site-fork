### An Introduction to DIY Laser Cutters

#### Talk Description:

Laser cutting is a technology that uses a laser to cut materials, and is typically used for industrial manufacturing applications, but is also starting to be used by schools, small businesses, and hobbyists. Laser cutting works by directing the output of a high-power laser through optics and CNC (computer numerical control).

Common uses are cutting and engraving patterns onto materials such as wood, leather and acrylic, and is considered one of the faster processes in rapid prototyping. Join us for this sharing session to demystify the laser cutter machine!

#### Speaker Profile

Kee Wee Teng is an innovative machine designer and builder, and has worked on a multitude of fabrication machines, including CNCs, 3D Printers, vacuum formers and laser cutters. Dismayed by the slow decline of manufacturing capabilities in Singapore, he set out to set an example by building a machine in 6 months with limited resources and knowledge, able to do additive, subtractive, forming and cutting manufacturing, and showcased it at Makerfaire 2016. He hopes to inspire and encourage others in Singapore to adopt the same innovative Maker spirit that built early Singapore! Kee Wee was also recently featured in Challenge Magazine: https://www.challenge.gov.sg/print/feature/taking-things-into-their-own-hands

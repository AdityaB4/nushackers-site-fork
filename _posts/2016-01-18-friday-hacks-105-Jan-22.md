# That Roomba Raspberry Pi Kinect Hack

### Description

While procrastinating one day, Fazli thought it was a good idea to duct-tape a Kinect, a Raspberry Pi, a Roomba and an empty biscuit tin together. So, he went and duct-taped a Kinect, a Raspberry Pi, a Roomba and an empty biscuit tin together. It wasnâ€™t such a great idea.

Come to the talk anyway to see Fazli describe what he learnt during his miserable experience in agonizing detail. Also, witness live demos of his robot attempting Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) of a totally untested environment. What could possibly go wrong?

### Unleashing the power of kubectl

#### Talk Description:

Do you use kubectl? How efficiently do you use Kubernetes? In this talk,
we will explore some of the most powerful, interesting and lesser-known
features of the Kubernetes command line i.e kubectl, such as how you can
set the editor of your choice for kubectl, how to learn about Kubernetes
resources using kubectl only, and a lot more cool stuff. This will also
be useful for people dealing with the OpenShift CLI (oc).

While preparing for the CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator) exam,
I found some of the commands very interesting and worth sharing
with a wider audience. This will not just unleash the power of Kubernetes,
but these tricks will help you learn new things about kubectl which will
improve your productivity with kubectl.

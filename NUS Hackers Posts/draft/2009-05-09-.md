Keep your fingers crossed, we're planning a hackfest on May 23. It'll be at Microsoft again! Drop by, chill out, do some programming, talk to others and maybe hatch a new project or seven. We've had quite a bit of fun the past few hackfests, even though we haven't taken as many photos.

We'll drop more details closer to the date, but it looks like another Saturday afternoon of good clean hacking. Don't miss this one if you can!

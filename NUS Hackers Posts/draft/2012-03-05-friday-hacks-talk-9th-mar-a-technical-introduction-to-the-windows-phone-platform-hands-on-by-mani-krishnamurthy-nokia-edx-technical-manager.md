<strong>Talk details:</strong>
"My talk will be a brief on Windows Phone ecosystem and the current opportunities in it for local developers for around 30 mins.

No pre-talk preparation; as what I am giving them is insights into the benefits of Nokia - Microsoft partnerships and how developers benefit from this. Nothing technical; nothing hands-on."

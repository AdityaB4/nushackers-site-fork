  <h3>What is Hacking?</h3>

  <p>The simplest way to define hacking is: 'playful cleverness'. We usually take it to mean the act of creating interesting software, but 'playful cleverness' may be applied to all sorts of things: life, music, hardware, food. More on this →</p>

  <h3>Formerly linuxNUS</h3>

  <p>We were formerly known as linuxNUS, an open source advocate in NUS. We have since changed our name to reflect the shifting nature of our organization: we now spend more time promoting hacking, programming-for-fun, and free/open-source-software use in the NUS community. More on the name change →</p>

In the jargon of the computer programmer, a hacker is someone who strives to solve problems in elegant and ingenious ways. NUS Hackers is a student-run organization committed to the spread of hacker culture & free/open-source software. We provide a support system for hackers in NUS who are currently building things (be it for charity, business or pleasure). We also hold workshops, run hackfests, and maintain open source code for the NUS community.

### What We Do

We have weekly meetings every Friday called Friday Hacks. They include one or two technical talks, followed by a hacking session.

Once a year, we run a series of technical workshops called hackerschool. We also run the Hack&Roll hackathon in the second semester of the academic year. Our coreteam members contribute to events like LadyPy and Software Freedom Day.

We maintain and release open source code for the NUS community (see: our code page). Students and staff who have built NUS-specific projects and can no longer maintain them may come to us to host and maintain their code.

We run Antinews, a community site for sharing hacker knowledge in Singapore.

We currently maintain Download@NUS. We have a small team of people working with the NUS Computer Centre to host scientific data. We also have a small team of hardware hackers who meet at Friday Hacks.

### Philosophy

We believe that hacking is necessary for good innovation. (In fact, the best computer-related startups and technologies have all come from hackers). As an extension to that, we think tinkering is win-win-win: you learn new things, you get to show off, and you become more attractive to employers.

(Though, honestly, most of the time we hack because we think it’s fun).

### Goal

Our long term goal is to build a healthy community of passionate hackers in NUS. We think that this benefits everyone: professors benefit because they are able to source for good programmers; startups and tech companies benefit because they are able to recruit from a central pool; students benefit because they get to meet and learn from like-minded peers (and get opportunities, i.e.: from professors and tech companies). We think we are 2, 3 years away from this goal.

### Management

NUS Hackers is managed by a coreteam of student-volunteers. If you’d like to request a workshop, get us to publicize your code, or ask us a question, we recommend that you send us an email through our contact form.

### Current Coreteam

Vishnu[President] is a CS student who’s interested in too many things at once. You can learn absolutely nothing more about him at his website vishnuprem.com, but you should follow him on twitter; He’s contactable at vishnu@nushackers.org

Benedict is a Computer Science undergraduate with interests in Software Engineering. You can reach him at benedict@nushackers.org

Michael is a Computer Science undergraduate. More about him at ymichael.com.

Eli James/Cedric is a Computer Science undergraduate, and is responsible for Novelr and Pandamian. He loves ebook formats, Python, and cats. (Well, and tea. Lots of tea.) More about him at elijames.org.

Tay Ray Chuan is a software enthusiast and student, with interests as disparate as history and philosophy. In between ploughing through his tutorials, he hacks randomly, mainly in Python and JavaScript. In addition to working on open-source, he hopes to give back to the community through his involvement in NUS Hackers.

Omer Iqbal is a Computer Engineering undergraduate who loves drinking language Koolaid. These days his passions include clojure hacking, Westerosi politics and cheap coffee.

Jerome is a Computer Science undergraduate. More about him at ayulin.net.

Pallav is a Computer Science undergraduate and AI enthusiast. More about him at pshinghal.com.

Camillus is a Computer Science undergraduate interested in information security. More about him at qxcg.net.

Yujian is a Computer Science undergraduate who likes reading, mathematics, computer science, technology and Spongebob. He also likes to try out new stuff when he’s free. More about him at yjyao.com.

Johannes is a Computer Science undergraduate. He goes by aquaroris on the net.

Zhi An  is a Computer Science undergraduate and also goes by Anzai. When he’s not doing school work, he loves reading technology news (Hacker News is his favourite) and trying out new Linux distributions. More about him at ngzhian.wordpress.com.

Joey is a Computer Science undergraduate.

Stacey is a Computer Science undergraduate who loves trekking, philosophy, and tea. More about him at staceytay.com.
